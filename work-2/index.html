      <h2>Work-In-Progress-2 Reflection</h2>
      <p>I was really excited for this unit because I have a little bit of experience using Photoshop from a class in high school but wanted some more in-depth knowledge on it. I see Photoshop as an immensely powerful tool that can be used for a lot more than just picture editing. It allows you to make basically any visual element that you could ever desire. That being said, I found that the Photoshop work we did in the class to be very creative, helpful, and dare I say fun. Throughout the various assignments I found that my Photoshop abilities were improving nicely. The best thing about Photoshop being such a ubiquitous tool is that someone else in the world has experienced the problem you’re experiencing or found a solution to some weird bug you are encountering. On top of this, there is an infinite supply of YouTube tutorials, forums, quick tips, and pretty much any other resource you would ever need to learn more about a specific tool or fix in Photoshop. </p>

      <p>For the first Photoshop project, we had to edit an old advertisement in any way we wanted - whether it be for parody, or marketing a different product completely. When browsing the ads, I got quite a few ideas on which to choose and what I wanted to do with it. In the end, I decided to go with a black and white Corona typewriter ad. I chose to make the advertisement more honest. Instead of bragging about famous writers who use the typewriter and promising that if you got a Corona you will write the next big hit, I changed the ad to say that a Corona will help you write okayish. I got inspiration for the ad from sites like the Onion which often do articles on if the news was extremely honest and less formal. I think it turned out really well, thanks mostly to Adobe’s new font-matching tool in Photoshop. It took a while to get the fonts, colors and sizing just right but now you have to look real hard to tell the ad is not the original.</p>

      <p>In the second project, we got two movie genres and had to mix them together in some way. Our group first got comedy, so of course we had to choose Step Brothers. Then, we got super hero as our second genre. After some deliberation in our group, we had the great idea to use Thor and Loki. This worked out perfectly on so many levels in that Thor and Loki are step brothers like Will Ferrel and John C. Reilly in the film. The editing was a bit tricky, as I had no prior knowledge of the various stamping tools and we wanted to Photoshop the original character’s faces onto Thor and Loki. In the end I am really happy with the result and I learned a valuable new tool in Photoshop with the various stamp tools. </p>

      <p>The third project was very different from the first two. It involved storyboarding a video using Photoshop. For this project, I thought it would be cool to make a storyboard of what fair use laws are because they have been an increasingly important topic in digital media since the dawn of sites like YouTube. The storyboard panels are kind of rough in design due to my complete lack of drawing skills, but I tried to make the storyboard as informative as possible with detailed examples of what fair use is and what is considered fair use. Overall, this project taught me a lot about Photoshop folders/grouping, and I learned a lot about fair use in the process.</p>

      <p>Lastly, we had to design a logo for a fake company we created. I chose to make a clean energy company logo as all of the logos for these types of company are always the same: some variation of a plant or other bright-green logo to show how the company loves the environment. I find this design to be tired and boring so I decided to take a different route with some minimalist designs like a cloud with a lightning bolt and a watermill with the sun behind it. This was definitely the hardest of the projects in Photoshop because of the creativity involved in thinking up and then physically making the logo.</p>

      <p>Overall, I think that the Photoshop projects were very fun and interesting. As a student I think it should be almost mandatory to learn a skill like Photoshop as it is a powerful tool that would help greatly in daily life and my career and should be taught along with the other popular design tools like Word, PowerPoint, etc. Though I am by no means an expert at Photoshop, this entire unit demonstrated how important these tools are to digital design and along with the textbook and lectures, I learned a lot more about media design as a whole.</p>
