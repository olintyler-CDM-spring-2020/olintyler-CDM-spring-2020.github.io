        This soundscape demonstrates an environment of fears on the sea. It features a slow and dramatic transition from calm waves to an unsettling storm with a lovecraftian beast wrecking the ship and its crew.

        <h2>Genre Choices</h2>
        <p>For the genre remix Photoshop project, my group and I got the genres comedy and superhero to mash up into a new movie poster. We chose to add superhero elements to the <em>Step Brothers</em> poster using Thor and Loki. If I were to reimagine this in another genre I would probably change superhero to horror. I always find films like these very interesting since the genres are such polar opposites of each other, but it makes for great movies like <em>Shaun of the Dead</em>, <em>Zombieland</em>, etc. I also think it would be interesting to see what elements would be added to the poster to make it fit the horror genre but still have the comedy elements. I think that for revising the project for an expert, the photoshopping of faces would have to be seamless for it to look like a natural, unphotoshopped poster.</p>

        <h2>Visual Aspect Choices</h2>
        <p>I think a great example of my use of visual aspects throughout the course has been my website as a whole. This website has had countless decisions made for it in regards to things like color, fonts, captions, scale, etc. At first, the design I was going for with the site was a Google “material design” look that was quite simple and flat looking. This design included a roboto blocky-style font and grayscale colors along with just some padding on the top and sides of the site. My revamped design is much nicer looking in my opinion with a futura style font and my own custom logo I designed in Photoshop. In addition, I changed the formatting to look more cinematic with a much narrower width. Under different circumstances, say a more formal website or portfolio, I would definitely be more conservative in my overall design. My current design, while appearing very nice to me, is a bit more “fun” and a lot less formal than my former design. I think if I were to design this site for a purpose like a digital resume, my last design would be preferred for its professionalism.</p>

        <h2>Comparisons</h2>
        <p>Sifting through multiple options and electing what appears to be the best one is obviously an essential skill when it comes to design. It happens at every step in the design process: fonts, colors, etc. In my projects, the most notable comparison I had to make was in choosing an ad to edit for my first Photoshop project. When choosing, I thought to myself, “What changes can I make to this one? What am I trying to accomplish with my changes?”. With this in mind, I decided I wanted something humorous and satirical, so I looked through all the options and saw what I could change about each advertisement to accomplish this. I ended up choosing the Corona typewriter over a few other ads I had in mind because I thought that firstly, it would make for the funniest design, and secondly, I thought that it would look the best when changed. The ad is in black and white and is mostly text, so using the font-lookup tool I could select a font that most similarly emulates those in the ad. I think the comparison would be more effective with more revisions as it would allow me to improve the changes and make the overall design more refined.</p>

        <h2>Most Frustrating</h2>
        <p>I think the most frustrating project I worked on definitely has to be the logo project. The reason I found this project so frustrating isn’t because the project was necessarily too hard, but it involved a lot of creativity. First, I had to come up with a fake business. I ended up choosing a green energy company, but it took a lot of thinking about what kind of logo I could make for a certain type of business. In addition, once I had a fake company in mind, it took even longer to think of what a cool, stylish logo for said company would be. My frustrations are noticeable in the fact that I ended up designing two different logos for this project just because I couldn’t pick what exactly I wanted in it. I overcame this obstacle by writing down things I would want to see in a green energy company logo and workshopping a few ideas. Ultimately I decided on two designs I would like to see and picked them. From this, I learned that design isn’t always about making things look pretty. It’s also quite a process to brainstorm ideas and use your creativity to think up a design and then implement it.</p>

        <h2>Proudest Example</h2>
        <p>I’d have to say that my proudest achievement in this class is definitely my reflection for envisioning my design. I’m not the strongest writer, but I think that my writing has definitely improved over the course of the semester. At first, my design writeup was pretty short and overall mediocre. It talked about some simple design elements I would like to see and used vague language like “simple” and “clean”. After we discussed this vague wording in the class and were told to revise our original design writeup, I went back and looked at what I specifically wanted to see in my website and how I could accomplish it. That’s when I decided to use a Wes Anderson inspired design for my website and really got to work on how my website should look and function. I’m glad we were told to revise our design because I am really proud of how it turned out and how I implemented each part of my envisioning into my design. Though there were some parts of my design writeup that never got implemented, I think that going back and revising my writeup allowed me to take a closer look at my website and overall goals for the class. In the future, I would like to use this mindset more of constant revision and additions to perfect future designs. That way I could end up with a final product I am both happy with and proud of.</p>

        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>All in all, this course has been one of the most helpful ones I have taken at Pitt as far as real-world use goes. It has taught me invaluable skills in media creation, creative writing, and digital design. Though I had some previous exposure to some of the tools used in the course, I think that the further practice with them, along with the textbook and lecture’s explanations on how to properly utilize them with design concepts, has further strengthened my design skills. This can be seen in my project samples as seen on this website. </p>
        <p>Creativity was never my strong suit. As a computer science student, I have always dealt with things in a literal sense with problem solving skills. Though this does involve some creative thinking to design solutions, it feels very different from the type of creativity used in this course throughout the semester. In this class, I got to use artistic creativity to design creative pieces such as my first creative writing piece, my many design revisions, and with the various Photoshop and sound projects we did. As I said in my “most frustrating” part of the showcase, I find coming up with creative ideas or ways to change things pretty difficult, as in the logo project. In my opinion, this course has allowed me to strengthen these creative skills with these projects by giving me a general sense of what my goals are with the project and brainstorming ideas. This is really exemplified in the Photoshop projects and the soundscape. With the movie poster project, working in a group and bouncing ideas off each other made for both a fun group project and an interesting result with our final poster. </p>
        <p>I imagine that if an audience were to react to my final portfolio, they would be amused by how my work has changed throughout the semester. I felt that with the more projects we did and the more we learned, my work got more detailed and had a nicer overall feel as I incorporated these new design concepts in them. A great example of this is with my website design as a whole. My website transformed from a barebones shell of a website into an awesome design that incorporates concepts from the readings such as the rule-of-thirds we learned in Principles of Design. Though concepts like this might not be too noticeable outright, they definitely make a subtle difference in that the site ended up looking much more organized and fun to use. The combination of revision and learning new concepts allowed me to revise my design into something I am proud of.</p>
        <p>For peer reviewing, I believe that it has played a key role in my development as a reader, writer, and thinker. Though we only really had one “official” peer review, group projects, asking questions, and showing off my projects to my desk-neighbor all helped me in the same sense. There is a reason why so many college courses use group projects. These moments where we analyze each other’s work and exchange ideas help further our development, no matter if we are the one reviewing or the one being reviewed. As a reader, peer reviewing taught me to look deeper into what I am reviewing and pay attention to all parts of the work. As a writer and thinker, getting feedback allows me to learn from my mistakes and to be constantly improving. Overall, I find peer reviewing to be a great activity to use, especially in design, to learn from others.</p>
        <p>I think that thinking about the target audience and purpose greatly impacts how my work is done. When working on a personal project, say a writing piece for fun or a coding project I think would be interesting, I tend to focus on what I want to see out of it and what can be accomplished. This concept changes with projects that I plan to show off, such as my website, presentation, and samples. With these kinds of projects, I try to strike a balance between my own goals and the purpose of what I am trying to achieve with what I envision the target audience to be and what they want to see. This is important with things like the logo design project. With this project, I tried to envision what people would want to see in a green energy company and its logo, along with my personal ideas on how to make my logo stand out from other, similar companies. It is important to reach this balance because having a sense of purpose is important to making your work feel more personal, but an audience might not have the same tastes as yourself. That’s why it is essential to keep in mind concepts like framing, as mentioned by Lidwell. I have used ideas like framing throughout my projects to give a certain feel to my work depending on how I want the audience to react. For example, my Corona typewriter ad edit used a more negative framing to poke fun at the ad itself and people who think that having a new, flashy product would help them improve their work over practice and feedback. </p>
        <p>My writing process and techniques are pretty unique in the components I use. I have always been a big fan of satirical writing like The Onion and surrealist writers like Kafka. My work often takes inspiration from these categories and are often factored into my work to give them a funny and sarcastic tone while still getting my point across. This can be seen in some of my projects like my first creative writing piece. The piece incorporates these elements by delivering an absurd, over-the-top question on Reddit about a dog who has become a musclehead by getting the wrong injection from a veterinarian. Though the work is extremely silly, its main goal was to satirize the ridiculous or often fake questions asked on internet forums like Reddit.</p>
        <p>Overall, my goal in this course was to read and learn more about design principles and improve my writing, and to learn helpful tools to assist me outside of class. After taking this course, I can say that I most certainly have accomplished these goals. I have always been interested in creative writing and have wanted to improve my writing skills overall, and this class has done a lot to help me with this in exercises like the creative writing piece and the numerous reflections we worked on. Furthermore, reading others works and being taught the many design concepts we learned has helped me improve as a designer and taught me important lessons on feedback and criticism. Lastly, the tools we have used throughout the course prove to be extremely useful in many aspects, not just in this class. Tools like Photoshop were essential for us to learn and in my opinion, great tools for anyone to learn regardless of profession. I would love to continue to learn Photoshop as it has a seemingly endless amount of uses and can help me with future projects and designs, or even with something as simple as a family photo I would like to edit.</p>
