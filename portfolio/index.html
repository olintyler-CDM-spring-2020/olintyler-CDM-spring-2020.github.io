        This soundscape demonstrates an environment of fears on the sea. It features a slow and dramatic transition from calm waves to an unsettling storm with a lovecraftian beast wrecking the ship and its crew.

        <h2>Genre Choices</h2>
        <p>For the genre remix Photoshop project, my group and I got the genres comedy and superhero to mash up into a new movie poster. We chose to add superhero elements to the <em>Step Brothers</em> poster using Thor and Loki. If I were to reimagine this in another genre I would probably change superhero to horror. I always find films like these very interesting since the genres are such polar opposites of each other, but it makes for great movies like <em>Shaun of the Dead</em>, <em>Zombieland</em>, etc. I also think it would be interesting to see what elements would be added to the poster to make it fit the horror genre but still have the comedy elements. I think that for revising the project for an expert, the photoshopping of faces would have to be seamless for it to look like a natural, unphotoshopped poster.</p>

        <h2>Visual Aspect Choices</h2>
        <p>I think a great example of my use of visual aspects throughout the course has been my website as a whole. This website has had countless decisions made for it in regards to things like color, fonts, captions, scale, etc. At first, the design I was going for with the site was a Google “material design” look that was quite simple and flat looking. This design included a roboto blocky-style font and grayscale colors along with just some padding on the top and sides of the site. My revamped design is much nicer looking in my opinion with a futura style font and my own custom logo I designed in Photoshop. In addition, I changed the formatting to look more cinematic with a much narrower width. Under different circumstances, say a more formal website or portfolio, I would definitely be more conservative in my overall design. My current design, while appearing very nice to me, is a bit more “fun” and a lot less formal than my former design. I think if I were to design this site for a purpose like a digital resume, my last design would be preferred for its professionalism.</p>

        <h2>Comparisons</h2>
        <p>Sifting through multiple options and electing what appears to be the best one is obviously an essential skill when it comes to design. It happens at every step in the design process: fonts, colors, etc. In my projects, the most notable comparison I had to make was in choosing an ad to edit for my first Photoshop project. When choosing, I thought to myself, “What changes can I make to this one? What am I trying to accomplish with my changes?”. With this in mind, I decided I wanted something humorous and satirical, so I looked through all the options and saw what I could change about each advertisement to accomplish this. I ended up choosing the Corona typewriter over a few other ads I had in mind because I thought that firstly, it would make for the funniest design, and secondly, I thought that it would look the best when changed. The ad is in black and white and is mostly text, so using the font-lookup tool I could select a font that most similarly emulates those in the ad. I think the comparison would be more effective with more revisions as it would allow me to improve the changes and make the overall design more refined.</p>

        <h2>Most Frustrating</h2>
        <p>I think the most frustrating project I worked on definitely has to be the logo project. The reason I found this project so frustrating isn’t because the project was necessarily too hard, but it involved a lot of creativity. First, I had to come up with a fake business. I ended up choosing a green energy company, but it took a lot of thinking about what kind of logo I could make for a certain type of business. In addition, once I had a fake company in mind, it took even longer to think of what a cool, stylish logo for said company would be. My frustrations are noticeable in the fact that I ended up designing two different logos for this project just because I couldn’t pick what exactly I wanted in it. I overcame this obstacle by writing down things I would want to see in a green energy company logo and workshopping a few ideas. Ultimately I decided on two designs I would like to see and picked them. From this, I learned that design isn’t always about making things look pretty. It’s also quite a process to brainstorm ideas and use your creativity to think up a design and then implement it.</p>

        <h2>Proudest Example</h2>
        <p>I’d have to say that my proudest achievement in this class is definitely my reflection for envisioning my design. I’m not the strongest writer, but I think that my writing has definitely improved over the course of the semester. At first, my design writeup was pretty short and overall mediocre. It talked about some simple design elements I would like to see and used vague language like “simple” and “clean”. After we discussed this vague wording in the class and were told to revise our original design writeup, I went back and looked at what I specifically wanted to see in my website and how I could accomplish it. That’s when I decided to use a Wes Anderson inspired design for my website and really got to work on how my website should look and function. I’m glad we were told to revise our design because I am really proud of how it turned out and how I implemented each part of my envisioning into my design. Though there were some parts of my design writeup that never got implemented, I think that going back and revising my writeup allowed me to take a closer look at my website and overall goals for the class. In the future, I would like to use this mindset more of constant revision and additions to perfect future designs. That way I could end up with a final product I am both happy with and proud of.</p>
