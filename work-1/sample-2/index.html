      <h2>Envisioning my design</h2>

      <p>In my opinion, what makes a website engaging really depends on what kind of website it is, how it looks and functions, and how useful it is. I think an engaging website is one that is easy-to-use, sleekly designed, and full of eye-catching content. A really good example of this would be social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc. that have a simple and easy-to-use layout that displays front-and-center new updates on friends, family, current events, or other interesting things. As said before, an aesthetically pleasing website would be one that is simple, functional, and easy on the eyes. I think a great example of this is Craigslist. Though it looks dated, it is extremely easy to use, and it uses a very unique but uncomplicated color palette and font. That being said, what makes a website memorable is the content. A website can be aesthetically pleasing and be designed well, but if it is full of boring filler or is a giant wall of text then it wouldn’t be too memorable or impressive at all.

      As far as a design concept for my own site, I believe a design I would like to implement would be something simple, but with personality. I really enjoy certain styles like Google’s flat/material style that is very simplistic but pops with color. I think something like this, but more personal feeling instead of a typical all-white or grey, cold-feeling page would look great and also have some personality that would keep the reader interested in it. For example, a dropdown menu, scrolling animations for page sections, and a nice color palette would go a long way on making my website look like something I would be proud of.</p>
