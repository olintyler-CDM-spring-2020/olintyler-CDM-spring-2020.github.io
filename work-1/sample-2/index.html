      <h2>Envisioning my design</h2>
        <p>In my opinion, what makes a website engaging really depends on what kind of website it is, how it looks and functions, and how useful it is. I think an engaging website is one that is easy-to-use, sleekly designed, and full of eye-catching content. A really good example of this would be social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc. that have a simple and easy-to-use layout that displays front-and-center new updates on friends, family, current events, or other interesting things. As said before, an aesthetically pleasing website would be one that is simple, functional, and easy on the eyes. I think a great example of this is Craigslist. Though it looks dated, it is extremely easy to use, and it uses a very unique but uncomplicated color palette and font. That being said, what makes a website memorable is the content. A website can be aesthetically pleasing and be designed well, but if it is full of boring filler or is a giant wall of text then it wouldn’t be too memorable or impressive at all.

        As far as a design concept for my own site, I believe a design I would like to implement would be something simple, but with personality. I really enjoy certain styles like Google’s flat/material style that is very simplistic but pops with color. I think something like this, but more personal feeling instead of a typical all-white or grey, cold-feeling page would look great and also have some personality that would keep the reader interested in it. For example, a dropdown menu, scrolling animations for page sections, and a nice color palette would go a long way on making my website look like something I would be proud of.

        Originally, I wrote about wanting to have a “simple” website with personality. Looking back on this, it seems to be a very broad design concept. What I would consider a “simple” personality would be one that follows a theme of Wes Andersonism. This would entail a website with a mostly muted, flat, and pastel color palate and one or two very bright and popping colors. This would also mean simple geometric shapes with noticeable symmetry. Text for a site like this would be a font like Futura, a font with spaced-out round letters, usually in all caps – almost like an old 1930’s advertisement. Another part to this would be the sneaking in of literature aspects like dividing things by "Chapter" as opposed to sections.
        In addition, I think a “theme switcher” design concept would be very cool. There would be my normal theme as described above, but also a dark mode and some other fun modes to add personality. For example, I think it would be very funny to have a theme contradicting my desired concept by having a way to switch to a theme that would look like an early 2000’s GeoCities page.
