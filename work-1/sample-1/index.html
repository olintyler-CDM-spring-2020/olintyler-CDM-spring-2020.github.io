      <h2>Strange vaccine side effects for new dog?</h2>
      <p>Hey Reddit, 3 weeks ago while returning from work I found a stray dog in an alley eating out of a dumpster belonging to a local Japanese restaurant. At first I brought it to the veterinarian because it looked a little malnourished and sick. I didn’t plan on taking him home (my parents are not fans of dogs), but I got so attached to him over that day that I ended up naming him and taking him home. The vet says that he is a mutt, a mix of some sort of lab and a German Shepherd. I decided to name him Sushi after what he was eating when I found him. Last week, I took him to the vet again to finish his check-up and get a final round of vaccinations. After that, I started to notice Sushi acting strange. The first thing I noticed last Saturday was his sudden attention to the music I played which was often aggressive and inspirational for when I’m doing chores around the house or working out. Then, just the other day, I see him doing weird repetitive movements like standing up and lying down. He has also gotten more aggressive when playing, and has started beating me every time we play tug of war. Just last night, I even caught Sushi eating some protein powder that I left on the kitchen counter. My question is, is this the result of one of the vaccines he was given during his check up? Is it possible that he was accidentally given human growth hormones instead of dog ones? I am wondering how I can deter this behavior until he takes it too far and I catch him using steroids like a canid Lance Armstrong.</p>
