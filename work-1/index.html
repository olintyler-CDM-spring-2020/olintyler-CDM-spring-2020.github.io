    	<h2>Work-In-Progress-1 Reflection</h2>
    	<p>
			As someone with past experience in many of the tools that are being used in the class, I approached my assignments so far in the class as a way to improve upon my current skills and incorporate previously unknown design concepts in them. As a computer science student, I know a lot about the logic behind web design, but I did not have a lot of prior knowledge on design elements that actually improved on the website’s look and content. In addition, I think this class has already helped me improve on my creative writing skills that were definitely lacking before I took this class. This is evident in my first creative writing work poking fun at the often ridiculous questions posed on sites like reddit and Twitter. It is a breath of fresh air to be able to write something satirical and fun for a class as opposed to the many academic and serious papers I have written over the course of my college career. I am still going back and changing parts of both this creative writing project and my overall design concept as I learn more and my “design tastes” change. 
		</p><p>
			In my first design concept, I talked about how I wanted to create a website that incorporated a “simple” and “clean” design, as seen with websites like Twitter or Google’s popular “Material Design” concept that can be seen all over the internet and in various phone applications. I also stated that I wanted some “personality” to my website and talked about having a bright color scheme. Upon looking back at this design concept (and being roasted a little in class about the vagueness of it), I rewrote my concept to reflect one that is more specific and concrete than throwing around words like “simple”, “clean”, and “personality” and replaced them with actual ideas on a potential design. Now, my current vision is to have my site incorporate a design with inspiration from Wes Anderson’s projects, as I love the cinematography and overall feel of his films. This kind of design, with bright, contrasting colors and an old-timey feel really speaks to my artistic and design tastes, as I have always been interested in photography and architecture with this style of design, from Cuban classic cars to Dutch row-homes. To be honest, my current design still needs more fleshing out and the site will be updated more throughout the semester to reflect these design elements, but I am also careful to not succumb to scope-creep by going too crazy and using up all of my time to meticulously add a bunch of contrasting design elements to my website. I worry about this because, as seen in my design concept, I have trouble sticking to one specific design and want to mash all of my ideas about designs I think would be interesting into my website, when I should stick with one main design and incorporate the others using bits and pieces from them if they fit.
		</p><p>
			Moving forward, I am quite interested in the upcoming topics and would like to see how they improve upon my current skill set. I previously have taken a Photoshop class in high school that was very introductory, but I also have some independent experience using Photoshop for random projects and personal editing. That being said, I am by no means an expert and have gotten quite rusty at doing anything more than the absolute basics in Photoshop. I am excited to see how this class will help me further these skills, specifically in regards to visual elements I still do not know much about such as contrast, hue, etc. I also am hoping to get to work more with tools that I am unfamiliar with such as the proper use of layering, better blending techniques, and understanding terms like rasterization. As most of my work in Photoshop has been for personal projects, the tools I do know how to use I know how to use well, but I have very little as far as a concrete understanding on the fundamentals of Photoshop and how to efficiently use the tools I am given.
		</p><p>
			As for revising my current and past projects, I am editing and refreshing them from time to time as I learn more in the class and look back at them. I ask myself what my original goal was, how that has changed, and what still needs to be done. For example, I have redrafted and added onto my creative writing project a few times, but as someone who has not done a lot of creative writing in the past, there is still much to improve to my story and some tweaking to make the flow of the piece better and less awkward. To add on, I previously talked about how I completely rewrote my design concept to reflect something less vague and more fleshed out. Since my website will be built and added onto more as the semester goes, it is reasonable to say that my design concept will change. With the more I learn and add new design skills in my repertoire, the more I will tweak my design concept to reflect this new knowledge.
